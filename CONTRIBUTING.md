# Contributing
## How to contribut?
### Dev Branch
- Suggestions and improvements can be submitted to the Dev branch and will be published there immediately. I will then see if these are then also published.

### E-Mail
1. Please send me an email with your code suggestions. 
    - Please include your GitHub name in the email.
    - Please include where in the project the source code should be inserted.
    - Also give the source code a detailed description of the change.
2. I will then publish the code as a new pull request.
3. If the source code fits very well into the project, then the source code will be added to the project.

### In the Source Code
***Please start your source code for the project as follows:***
```c
